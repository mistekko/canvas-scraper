# Canvas Scraper

## About
I'll add something here later

## Usage
* You'll need Python (3), BeautifulSoup, and Playwright. Sorry about that.
  * Beautiful Soup and Playwright should both be installable through PIP.
  * Your distribution may also have some of these packages in the official repositories.
	  * If you are on Arch Linux, you should install Playwright this way
* You'll also need a `cookies.json` in the same directory as the script.
* Lastly, you'll need the URL of the class' "files" section. 
  * Not all classes have a "files" section because not all classes have files hosted on Canvas

## Invokation
`python3 main.py [URL]`

  
## Contributing
Open an issue, make a pull request, etc. 

## Future of this project
I'll probably make the UX a bit better by adding more customisability, but it works perfectly well for me at the moment, so I'm not confident that'll happen anytime soon.
